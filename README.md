# CONTAINUX

## Description

Containux is an Arch-based linux distribution built with user control and privacy in mind. 
In today's world users are constantly downloading and installing numerous applications from various sources on the internet.
More often than not, the user does not verify the source or "trustedness" of the application before running it on their computer.
In doing so the user has no idea what information such applications can access and send over the internet.
Applications with malicious behaviour can modify, delete or encrypt files thereby leaving the user at the mercy of the publisher.
Moreover, non-malicious applications can at the same time snoop around the user's filesystem and network potentially collecting sensitive, personal and identifying information without the user's consent.
Unfortunately a large percentage of the applications the average person runs on a daily basis are closed-source (the source code is not open to the public) and hence has to simply take the publisher's word on issues of privacy and security.

Containux is built with a solution to the aforementioned problem. It gets it's name in the merging(?) of the terms "container" and "linux". In short, containux provides the user appropriate tools to contain applications' behaviour. It can be used to restrict applications from accessing devices such as the microphone, webcam or even specific folders on the filesystem.
